  <p> When the buses are on route, the silence at Wabash bus station is deafening. On a rainy day the tin roof that covers the long row of benches becomes a battlefield, with raindrops pinging against it like fallen ammo, trickling down from the roof until it finally settles into the concrete below. </p>
  <p> When the sun is out, the buses cast long shadows when they pull into their designated places. The people who file from the side and front of each bus are mostly silent save for a few friendly hellos and goodbyes between familiar faces. </p>
  <p>“You know how people feel these days,” says frequent bus rider Issac Williams “most people feel sad or lost somebody, y’know.” COVID-19 forced Columbia’s public bus transportation system GoCOMO to enforce strict mask mandates along with other heightened safety measures and in March of 2020 GoCOMO also decided to provide fare free transportation.</p>
  <p>Following eased restrictions in January 2021, the number of people riding the city bus has increased, and on Sept. 20 City Council voted to extend fare free rides through the end of 2022.</p>
  <p>Although fare free rides don't solve everyone’s issues. Tommy Willow, a local musician, says he has to ride two buses just to get home to his apartment. “I can walk 30 minutes instead of taking the bus which takes literally an hour,” says Willow “but I don’t always feel like walking.”</p>
  <p>Willow’s extra long route home does provide him a chance to do something he loves though, popping in his earbuds and listening to music.</p>
  <p>“It’s just nice to be able to zone out and relax with my music,” he says “cause I have ADHD so it’s hard to focus on things most of the time.”</p>
  <p>Williams, who says he has no issues with the bus system, considers his rides a good place to make connections and meet other people.</p>
  <p>“I’ve been riding the bus since I was a kid,” says Williams, and as for the relationships he’s built with other bus riders, “white, black, kinda street wise, all kinds” he says.</p>
  <p>Wabash Railroad Station and Freight House, better known now as GoComo Wabash Station, was built in 1909 and serves as headquarters for GoComo. On October 11, 1979 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
  <p>Following a $2.5 million restoration and renovation project the station underwent in 2007, it is “certified at the LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Silver Level, meaning it meets national standards for energy efficiency and sustainable construction” according to the station’s Facebook page.</p>
  <p>GoComo currently offers six fixed routes as well as a para-transit route for those who require it, which run Monday through Friday between 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m, and Saturday between 9:30a.m. and 7:00 p.m. Buses do not run on Sundays.</p>
